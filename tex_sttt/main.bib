abstract="We introduce EAHyper, the first tool for the automatic checking of satisfiability, implication, and equivalence of hyperproperties. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple computation traces. A typical example is an information flow policy that compares the observations made by an external observer on execution traces that result from different values of a secret variable. EAHyper analyzes hyperproperties that are specified in HyperLTL, a recently introduced extension of linear-time temporal logic (LTL). HyperLTL uses trace variables and trace quantifiers to refer to multiple execution traces simultaneously. Applications of EAHyper include the automatic detection of specifications that are inconsistent or vacuously true, as well as the comparison of multiple formalizations of the same policy, such as different notions of observational determinism.",
