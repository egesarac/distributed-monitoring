\subsubsection{Proof of \cref{cl:stlsound}.}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\varphi$ be an STL formula and $(S,{\hb})$ be a distributed signal.
	Assume $[(S,{\hb}) \models \varphi]_+ = \top$.
	We want to show that $[(S,{\hb}) \models \varphi] = \top$.
	Expanding the definition of $[(S,{\hb}) \models \varphi]_+ = \top$, we have $w \models \varphi$ for all $w \in \tr^+(S,{\hb})$.
	By \cref{cl:trsound}, we have $\tr(S,{\hb}) \subseteq \tr^+(S,{\hb})$.
	Then, it holds that $w \models \varphi$ for all $w \in \tr(S,{\hb})$.
	Therefore, $[(S,{\hb}) \models \varphi] = \top$ by definition.
	The case of $[(S,{\hb}) \models \varphi]_+ = \bot$ follows from the same arguments.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Proof of \cref{cl:trsound}.}
\begin{proof}
	Let $(S,{\hb})$ be a distributed signal where $S = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$.
	Let $w = (y_1, \ldots, y_n) \in \tr(S,{\hb})$ be a trace.
	We want to show that $w \in \tr^+(S,{\hb})$.
	First, let us recall the definition of $\tr^+$.
	\[ \tr^+(S,{\hb}) = \{ (x_1', \ldots, x_n') \st \text{$x_i'$ is consistent with $x_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$}\} \]
	
	Let $1 \leq i \leq n$ be arbitrary.
	To show that $y_i$ is consistent with $x_i$, we need to show that $y_i$ is $I$-consistent with $x_i$ for all $I \in G_S$.
	Let $I = [t_0, s)$ be an arbitrary segment in $G_S$, let $(t_1, y_i(t_1)), \ldots, (t_\ell, y_i(t_\ell))$ be the edges of $y_i$ in segment $I$ with $t_j < t_{j+1}$ for all $1 \leq j < \ell$.
	To show that $y_i$ is $I$-consistent with $x_i$, we need to show that the expression $y_i(t_0) \cdot y_i(t_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot y_i(t_\ell)$ belongs to $\gamma(x_i,I)$.
	We sketch the proof idea below.
	
	Note that $w$ can be seen as a trace obtained through an $\varepsilon$-retiming of $S$ (see \cite[Section 4.2]{MomtazAB23}).
	Then, the timestamp $t$ of any edge of $x_i$ is mapped to some clock value in the range $(\theta_{\text{lo}}(t), \theta_{\text{hi}}(t))$.
	In particular, $|t - c^{-1}_i(t)| < \varepsilon$ for all $t \in \{t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_\ell\}$, where $c^{-1}_i(t)$ is the local clock value of $x_i$ that is mapped to $t$.
	
	Since $y_i$ has $\ell$ edges in $I$, it holds that $x_i$ has at least $\ell$ edges in $(t_0 - \varepsilon, s + \varepsilon)$.
	Since $I$ is a segment in $G_S$, there are $\ell$ of these that are consecutive such that the intersection of their uncertainty regions contain $(t_0,s)$, i.e., $(t_0,s) \subseteq \bigcap_{1 \leq j \leq \ell} (\theta_{\text{lo}}(t_j'), \theta_{\text{hi}}(t_j'))$ where $t_j' = c^{-1}_i(t_j)$ is the corresponding timestamp in $x_i$ for all $0 \leq j \leq \ell$.
	In particular, note that $y_i(t_j) = x_i(t_j')$ for all $0 \leq j \leq \ell$.
		
	Now, notice that, by definition, $\gamma(x_i, I)$ takes into account every edge of $x_i$ whose uncertainty region has a nonempty intersection with $I$, and preserves their order.
	Let $V_j$ be the set of value expressions capturing how $I$ relates with the uncertainty intervals of the edge $(t_j', x_i(t_j'))$ for all $1 \leq j \leq \ell$ (as defined in \cref{eq:valexprset}).
	Then, $\destutter(\{x_i(t_0')\} \cdot V_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot V_\ell) \subseteq \gamma(x_i, I)$.
	One can verify that for all $1 \leq j \leq \ell$, either $x_i(t_j')$ or $x_i(t_{j-1}') \cdot x_i(t_j')$ belongs to $V_j$.
	This allows us to choose a value expression $v_j$ from each $V_j$ such that $\destutter(\{x_i(t_0')\} \cdot v_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot v_\ell) = x_i(t_0') \cdot x_i(t_1') \cdot \ldots \cdot x_i(t_\ell')$, which concludes the proof. 

	Note that if there are more edges of $x_i$ with a timestamp smaller than $t_0'$ or larger than $t_\ell'$ whose uncertainty intervals intersect with $I$, then the corresponding set of value expressions is obtained either by prefixing or suffixing.
	In either case, we can choose $\epsilon$ from these sets for concatenation with the remaining edges' value expressions and obtain the desired result.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Proof of \cref{cl:algo}.}

\alert{TODO: Fix}

Let $w = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ be a (synchronous) trace and $E_w = \{t_1, \ldots, t_m\}$ be the set of timestamps for its edges with $t_j < t_{j+1}$ for all $1 \leq j < m$.
We define $\pi(w) = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$ where $v_i = x_i(0) \cdot x_i(t_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot x_i(t_m)$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$.
Let $(S,{\hb})$ be a distributed signal.
We define
\[ \pi(\tr^+(S,{\hb})) = \{ \pi(w) \st w \in \tr^+(S,{\hb}) \}. \]
Note that for each $u \in \pi(\tr^+(S,{\hb}))$ we have $u = \destutter(u)$.

Let $k \in \N$ and recall the function $\stutter_k : \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$.
For $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$, we define $\stutter_k(L) = \bigcup_{u \in L} \stutter_k(u)$.

Let $(S,{\hb})$ be a distributed signal such that $S = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ and $G_S = \{I_1, \ldots\ I_k\}$ where the segments with lower indices start (and end) before those with higher indices.
Moreover, we define 
\[ \Omega(S,{\hb}) = \{ \destutter(u) \st u \in \Gamma(S,{\hb}) \} \]
where
\[ \Gamma(S,{\hb}) = ( \stutter_3(\gamma(x_1, I_1)) \cdot \ldots \cdot \stutter_3(\gamma(x_1, I_k)), \ldots,  \stutter_3(\gamma(x_n, I_1)) \cdot \ldots \cdot \stutter_3(\gamma(x_n, I_k)) ). \]
Note that $\stutter_3$ only serves to capture the interleavings caused by the asynchronity within the segments.

\begin{lemma} \label{cl:eq}
	For every distributed signal $(S,{\hb})$, we have $\pi(\tr^+(S,{\hb})) = \Omega(S,{\hb})$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We briefly sketch each direction.
	The key observation is that both sets of value expressions are essentially defined through $\gamma$.

	Let $u \in \pi(\tr^+(S,{\hb}))$.
	By definition, $u$ is obtained from a trace $(x_1', \ldots, x_n')$ such that, for each $1 \leq i \leq n$, the signal $x_i'$ is $I$-consistent with $x_i$ for all $I \in G_S$.
	Namely, for each $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $I \in G_S$, the value expression obtained by concatenating the initial value of $x_i'$ in $I$ and the values of its edges in $I$ belongs to $\gamma(x_i, I)$.
	Then, one can verify that $u \in \Omega(S,{\hb})$.

	Let $u \in \Omega(S,{\hb})$.
	Recall that $u$ is obtained by choosing, for each $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $I \in G_S$, a value expression $v_{i,I} \in \gamma(x_i, I)$.
	By definition, there exists $(x_1', \ldots, x_n') \in \tr^+(S,{\hb})$ such that, for each $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $I \in G_S$, the behavior of $x_i'$ in the interval $I$ is given by the value expression $v_{i,I}$.
	Then, one can verify that $u \in \pi(\tr^+(S,{\hb}))$.
\end{proof}

We now proceed to prove \cref{cl:algo}.

\begin{proof}[\cref{cl:algo}]
	The proof goes by induction on the structure of $\varphi$.
	Let $(S,{\hb})$ be a distributed signal and $\varphi$ an STL formula.
	We sketch each case below.
%	Let $G_S$ be the canonical segmentation of $(S,{\hb})$ and let $I \in G_S$ be the first segment.
	
	\noindent\textbf{Atomic propositions.}
	For the base case, let $\varphi = p$ for some $p \in \AP$.
	Note that $\llbracket (S, {\hb}), I \models p \rrbracket$ expands to $\gamma(x_p, I)$ where $x_p$ is the signal encoding $p$.
	Then, it is easy to see that for every $u \in \Omega(S,{\hb})$ the component corresponding to $x_p$ starts with the value $\first(\gamma(x_p, I))$ (which is a singleton).
	Moreover, by \cref{cl:eq}, the same holds for $\pi(\tr^+(S,{\hb}))$, thus we conclude $[(S,{\hb}) \models p]_+ = \top$ (resp. $\bot$) iff $\first(\llbracket (S, {\hb}) \models p \rrbracket) = \{1\}$ (resp. $\{0\}$).

	\noindent\textbf{Negation.}
	Let $\varphi = \lnot \psi$ for some formula $\psi$ such that $[(S,{\hb}) \models \psi]_+$ and $\first(\llbracket (S, {\hb}) \models \psi \rrbracket)$ agree.
	If $[(S,{\hb}) \models \psi]_+ = \bot$ (resp. $\top$, $\,?$) and $\first(\llbracket (S, {\hb}) \models \psi \rrbracket) = \{0\}$ (resp. $\{1\}$, $\{0,1\}$), then, thanks to their inductive definitions, it is easy to see that $[(S,{\hb}) \models \lnot \psi]_+ = \top$ (resp. $\bot$, $\,?$) and $\first(\llbracket (S, {\hb}) \models \lnot \psi \rrbracket) = \{1\}$ (resp. $\{0\}$, $\{1,0\}$).

	\noindent\textbf{Conjunction.}
	Let $\varphi = \psi_1 \land \psi_2$ for some formulas $\psi_1, \psi_2$ such that $[(S,{\hb}) \models \psi_i]_+$ and $\first(\llbracket (S, {\hb}) \models \psi_i \rrbracket)$ agree for each $i \in \{1,2\}$.
	Suppose $[(S,{\hb}) \models \psi_i]_+ = \top$ and $\first(\llbracket (S, {\hb}) \models \psi_i \rrbracket) = \{1\}$ agree for each $i \in \{1,2\}$.
	Then,  $[(S,{\hb}) \models \psi_1 \land \psi_2]_+ = \top$ because $tr^+(S,{\hb})$ being contained in the languages of $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ implies that it is also contained in their intersection, and $\first(\llbracket (S, {\hb}) \models \psi_i \rrbracket) = \{1\}$ because the conjunction of any asynchronous product where both components start with 1 also starts with 1.
	The remaining cases follow from similar arguments.
		
	\noindent\textbf{Untimed until.}
	Let $\varphi = \psi_1 \land \psi_2$ for some formulas $\psi_1, \psi_2$ such that $[(S,{\hb}) \models \psi_i]_+$ and $\first(\llbracket (S, {\hb}) \models \psi_i \rrbracket)$ agree for each $i \in \{1,2\}$.
	
	
	
	\noindent\textbf{Timed until.}

\subsubsection{Generalization to Real-Valued Signals}
The methods described in \cref{sec:approach} and here can be generalized to handle arithmetic operations over real-valued signals and numerical predicates.
The key observation enabling this is that such finite-length piecewise-constant signals take only finitely many values.
Then, letting $\Sigma$ be a finite alphabet of these values, we are able to compute the $\gamma$ function as described.
To handle arithmetic operations, we can compute the asynchronous product of the signals involved and apply the given operation letter-by-letter.
Finally, to transform them into atomic propositions, we can compare the resulting value expressions letter-by-letter with a constant.
We call this approach \textsc{Orig}.
For example, suppose the asynchronous product of two signals $x_1$ and $x_2$ contains $(2\cdot2\cdot3, 1\cdot0\cdot1)$.
Applying addition to this pair letter by letter would give us $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 4$, and applying the comparison $> 2$ would result in the Boolean value expression $101$.
Repeating this for all pairs, we obtain the atomic proposition required.

As described in the previous subsection, we can efficiently represent and manipulate Boolean value expressions, avoiding explicit computation of asynchronous products.
This method does not apply to real-valued signals in general, therefore formulas with numerical predicates cause an additional overhead.
However, there are several ways how we can avoid explicit computation of asynchronous products for some classes of formulas and numerical predicates.

Since signals are completely asynchronous within segments, we can ignore the order and compute a set of potential \emph{values} instead of a set of \emph{sequences of values}.
Continuing the example above, instead of repeating the process above for all the interleavings, we can consider the value sets $X_1 = \{2,3\}$ for $x_1$ and $X_2 = \{0,1\}$ for $x_2$ to conclude by pairwise addition that the values of $x_1 + x_2$ come from the set $\{2, 3, 4\}$.
Then, we can simply assume that $x_1 + x_2$ is constant with one of these values within the segment.  
We call this approach \textsc{Fine}.
Notice that ignoring the order may lead to additionally overapproximating the original set of traces.
Therefore, \textsc{Fine} does not apply to formulas where the order of values matters, e.g.,  $x_1 > c_1 \until x_2 > c_2$.
Nonetheless, when it applies, e.g. for $\LTLalways((x_1 - x_2) \times x_3 > c)$, it saves us the time to explicitly compute the interleavings and the value expressions.

We can take \textsc{Fine} further and only consider the extreme values.
Some arithmetic operations are \emph{monotonic} in the sense that the extreme values of the output's value expressions can be computed from those of inputs.
For example, since $\min X_1 = 2$, $\max X_1 = 3$, $\min X_2 = 0$, and $\max X_2 = 1$, we immediately obtain that the minimal and maximal values of $x_1 + x_2$ are 2 and 4.
We call this approach \textsc{Coarse}.

Finally, instead of assuming that the monitor runs on a separate agent, we can assume it runs on one of the monitored agents.
This helps reduce the computational overhead caused by asynchrony by taking the agent where the monitor runs as a reference point, removing any uncertainty associated with this agent's signal.
We call this approach \textsc{Relative}.
We will demonstrate the benefits and downsides of each of these in \cref{sec:experiments}.
