\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

\emph{Distributed systems} are networks of independent agents that work together to achieve a common objective. Distributed systems are everywhere around us and come in many different forms. For example, cloud computing uses distribution of resources and services over the internet to offer to their users a scalable infrastructure with transparent on-demand access to computing power and storage. Swarms of drones represent another family of distributed systems where individual drones collaborate  to accomplish tasks like surveillance, search and rescue, or package delivery. While each drone operates independently,  it also communicates and coordinates with others to succesfully achieve their common objectives. The individual agents in a distributed system typically do not share a global clock. To coordinate actions across multiple agents, clock synchonisation is often needed. While perfect clock synchronisation is impractical due to network latency and node failures, algorithms such as the Network Time Protocol (NTP) allow agents to maintain a \emph{bounded skew} between the synchronised clocks. In that case, we say that a distributed system has \emph{partial asynchrony}. 

Formal verification of distributed system is a notoriously hard problem, due to the combinatorial explosion of all possible interleavings in the behaviors collected from individual agents. \emph{Runtime verification (RV)} provides a more pragmatic approach, in which a monitor observes a hehavior of a distributed system and checks its correctness against a formal specification. The problem of distributed RV under partial asynchrony assumption has been studied for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specification languages. The proposed solutions use Satisfiability-Modulo-Theory (SMT) solving to provide sound and complete distributed monitoring procedures. Although distributed RV monitors consume only a single distributed behavior at a time, this behavior can nevertheless have an excessive number of possible interleavings. Hence, the exact distributed monitors from the literature can still suffer from significant computational overhead. 

To mitigate this issue, we present an approach for \emph{approximate} RV of STL specifications under partial asynchrony. In essence, we abstract away potential inteleavings in distributed behaviors in a conservative manner, resulting in an effective over-approximation of global behaviors. This abstraction simplifies the representation of distributed behaviors and the monitoring operations required to evaluate temporal specifications. There is an inevitable trade-off in approximate RV -- gains in the monitoring speed-up may result in reduced accuracy. For some applications, reduced accuracy may not be acceptable. Therefore, we propose a methofology that cobines our approximate monitors with their exact counterparts, with the aim to benefit from the enhanced monitoring efficiency without sacrificing precision. We implemented our approach in a prototype tool and performed thorough evaluations on both synthetic and real-world case studies. We first demonstrated that our approximate monitors achieve speed-ups of several orders of magnitudes compared to the exact SMT-based distributed RV solution. We empirically characterized the classes of specifications and behaviors for which our approximate monitoring approach achieves good precision. We finally showed that by combining exact and approximate ditributed RV, there is still a significant efficiency gain on average without the sacrifice of the precision, even in cases where approximate monitors have low accuracy.
