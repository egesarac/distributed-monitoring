	In distributed systems with processes that do not share a global clock, \emph{partial synchrony} is 
	achieved by clock synchronization 
	that guarantees bounded clock skew among all applications. Existing solutions for distributed 
	runtime verification under partial 
	synchrony against temporal logic specifications are exact but suffer from significant 
	computational overhead. In this paper, we propose an \emph{approximate} 
	distributed monitoring algorithm for Signal Temporal Logic (STL) that mitigates this issue by 
	abstracting away potential interleaving behaviors. 
	This conservative abstraction enables a significant speedup of the distributed monitors, albeit 
	with a tradeoff in accuracy. We address this 
	tradeoff with a methodology that combines our approximate monitor with its exact counterpart, 
	resulting in enhanced monitoring 
	efficiency without sacrificing precision. We evaluate our approach with multiple 
	experiments, 
	showcasing its effectiveness and efficacy in 
	both real-world applications and synthetic examples.
